                <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
                <p><strong>Last Updated:</strong> January 2026</p>

                <p><strong>Sponteoai</strong> ("we," "our," or "us") respects your privacy and is committed to
                    protecting it through our compliance with this policy. This Privacy Policy describes the types of
                    information we may collect from you or that you may provide when you use the
                    <strong>ChillNote</strong> mobile application (the "App") and our practices for collecting, using,
                    maintaining, protecting, and disclosing that information.
                </p>

                <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
                <p>We collect limited information to provide the core functionality of ChillNote.</p>

                <h3>A. Information You Provide to Us</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Account Information:</strong> When you sign in using Apple or Google, we collect your
                        unique User ID and email address (if provided) to authenticate you and sync your data across
                        devices.</li>
                    <li><strong>User Content (Notes & Text):</strong> The text notes you create are stored securely on
                        our servers to enable synchronization between your devices.</li>
                    <li><strong>Audio Data (Ephemeral Processing Only):</strong> We collect audio data <strong>only when
                            you actively record a voice note</strong>.</li>
                </ul>
                <p><em>Important: Your raw audio files are processed using Ephemeral In-Memory Technology. This means
                        your audio is streamed to our processors for the sole purpose of transcription and summarization
                        and is immediately permanently deleted from our memory once the text is generated. We do not
                        store, archive, or retain your raw audio recordings on our servers' disk storage.</em></p>

                <h3>B. Information Collected Automatically</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Device Information:</strong> We may collect generic device information (e.g., model, OS
                        version) to ensure app compatibility.</li>
                    <li><strong>Usage Data (Local):</strong> Analytics events (e.g., "record_start",
                        "transcribe_success") are stored locally on your device for debugging purposes. We do not
                        automatically upload detailed behavioral tracking data to third-party advertising platforms.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>
                <p>We use the information we collect to:</p>

                    <li>Authenticate your identity.</li>
                    <li>Improve the accuracy of our AI services for your specific requests.</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>No Model Training:</strong> We do <strong>not</strong> use your personal notes or audio
                    recordings to train our proprietary artificial intelligence models.</p>

                <h2>3. Third-Party Data Sharing & AI Processors</h2>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Google Gemini (Google Cloud):</strong> We use Google's enterprise-grade AI APIs. Data
                        sent is used solely for processing your specific request and is not used to train foundational
                        public models.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>4. Data Retention & Security</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Zero Audio Retention:</strong> Raw audio files are never stored on our disks.</li>
