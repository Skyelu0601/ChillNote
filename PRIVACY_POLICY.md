# Privacy Policy

**Last Updated:** February 5, 2026

**Sponteoai** ("we," "our," or "us") respects your privacy and is committed to protecting it through our compliance with this policy. This Privacy Policy describes the types of information we may collect from you or that you may provide when you use the **ChillNote** mobile application (the "App") and our practices for collecting, using, maintaining, protecting, and disclosing that information.

This policy applies specifically to users located in the United States and is designed to comply with applicable US federal and state laws.

## 1. Information We Collect

We collect limited information to provide the core functionality of ChillNote.

### A. Information You Provide to Us
*   **Account Information:** When you sign in using Apple or Google, we collect your unique User ID and email address (if provided) to authenticate you and sync your data across devices.
*   **User Content (Notes & Text):** The text notes you create are stored securely on our servers to enable synchronization between your devices.
*   **Audio Data (Ephemeral Processing Only):** We collect audio data **only when you actively record a voice note**. 

    > **Important:** Your raw audio is processed for transcription and then discarded. We do **not** store, archive, or retain your raw audio recordings on our servers' disk storage.

### B. Information Collected Automatically
*   **Device Information:** We may collect generic device information (e.g., model, OS version) to ensure app compatibility.
*   **Usage Data (Local):** Analytics events (e.g., "record_start", "transcribe_success") are stored **locally on your device** for debugging purposes. We do not automatically upload detailed behavioral tracking data to third-party advertising platforms.

## 2. How We Use Your Information

We use the information we collect to:
*   Provide the App's functionality (transcription, summarization, and synchronization).
*   Authenticate your identity.
*   Improve the accuracy of our AI services for your specific requests.

**No Model Training:** We do **not** use your personal notes or audio recordings to train our proprietary artificial intelligence models.

## 3. Third-Party Data Sharing & AI Processors

To provide high-quality AI transcription and summarization, we utilize trusted third-party providers.

*   **Google Gemini (Google Cloud):**
    *   **Purpose:** We use Google's enterprise-grade AI APIs for speech-to-text transcription and content summarization.
    *   **Privacy Commitment:** Data sent to Google via our API integration is used solely for processing your specific request. According to our configuration and enterprise agreements, your data is **not** used by Google to train their foundational public models.
    *   **Data Flow:** Audio -> Sponteoai Server (Memory Only) -> Google Gemini API -> Text Returned -> Audio Deleted.

We do not sell, trade, or otherwise transfer your personally identifiable information to outside parties for marketing or advertising purposes.

## 4. Data Retention & Security

*   **Zero Audio Retention:** As stated, raw audio files are never stored on our servers' disks. They are transiently processed and discarded.
*   **Local Temporary Storage:** For crash recovery and pending transcription, audio recordings may be stored locally on your device and are deleted after successful processing or within 7 days.
*   **Note Retention:** Your text notes remain stored on our secure servers until you delete them or your account.
*   **Encryption:** All data transmitted between your device, our servers, and third-party APIs is encrypted using **TLS/SSL (HTTPS)** protocols.

## 5. Your Rights & Control

*   **Delete Account:** You can request the permanent deletion of your account and all associated data directly within the App settings. Upon this request, we permanently remove your user ID and all synchronized notes from our databases.
*   **Access & Correction:** You may edit or delete any note content within the App at any time.

## 6. Children's Privacy

Our App is not intended for children under 13 years of age. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If we learn we have collected or received personal information from a child under 13 without verification of parental consent, we will delete that information.

## 7. Changes to Our Privacy Policy

We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. If we make material changes to how we treat our users' personal information, we will notify you through the App or via email.
